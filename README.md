# Simon Clicked
The old fashion simon game is now on your machine. This is a personal project and a fun game to play with friends and family. The game is the old fashion simon says where you have to repeat the random pattern generated by the computer. You have to choose the button and then the computer generate a new button. You have to click the new button on addition to the previous buttons. If you have any suggestion, I can improve the application. You can also feel free to develop and modify the application as you wish.
